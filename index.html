            <h3>The microKORG XL</h3>
            It may look different from original microKorg, but the microKorg XL is cut very much from the same cloth. The microKORG may have set the standard for analog modeling synthesizers, but with the introduction of the microKorgXL, a new standard has been set. The MicroKorg XL inherited the microKORG's fat and powerful sounds, while adding keyboard staples such as electric piano and CX-3 organ. the next evolutionary step, the microKORG XL, delivers a fresh update to the sounds and look of the microKORG, making it an ideal compact keyboard.

            <h2>Sound</h2>
            <p>Lush analog modeled synthesizer sounds that are characteristic of the microKORG have been freshly added to the microKORG XL. In addition, for band use, the microKORG XL comes equipped with the piano sound from Korg's classic stage piano, the SGproX, as well as its hard-edged grand-type electric piano. This compact package also includes sounds from the M1 and the VOX organ, vintage tape-type string and flute machines, as well as other gorgeous sounds from keyboard history.
      
              Of course, these sounds can be played full-range like the originals that inspired them, either by using the onboard octave switch, or by connecting your choice of any MIDI-capable full-sized keyboard of choice. Each of these 128 programs are genuinely inspiring sounds, giving the microKORG XL plenty of variety to serve as your main keyboard or as a secondary keyboard in your rig.</p>

            <h2>Features</h2>
            <p>The microKORG XL featured a sound selector that lets you choose your sound using two large dials: "music genre" and "instrument category."
      
              The new microKORG XL has been updated with a new set "music genres" to fit today's evolving music scene. Now you can select a program that matches your song more intuitively than ever.
      
              For even more convenience, you can also leave one of the dials fixed and use the other dial to make program changes during a song (music genre fixed), or use the dial to select Vocoder variations (instrument category fixed).</p>

            <p>The microKORG XL+ can function as a powerful Vocoder that lets you connect a mic and use its audio input to shape the tonal character of the oscillator's sound to create "talking" effects.
      
              The Vocoder consists of a 16-band filter bank that can simulate the Vocoder sounds of the past and also shift the filter frequencies (Format Shift function) or adjust the level and pan of each band to dramatically change the overall sonic character. Using the Vocoder is an easy way to add sounds that can be found in todayâ€™s popular electronic music.
      
              Since a gooseneck microphone is included, you can immediately start using the Vocoder in your songs.</p>
